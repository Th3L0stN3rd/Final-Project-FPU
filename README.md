### Summary
We will use the GeneralEsportData.csv dataset available at EsportsEarnings.com. This dataset includes information of generic data on each esports related title. The data fields that are included are: Game, Release Date, Genre, Total Earnings, Online Earnings, Total Players, and Total Tournaments. We have  analyzed what specific trends with games and its genres over the years that accumulate the most with earnings and any potential outliers with these games over the years.
