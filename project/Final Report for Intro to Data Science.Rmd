## Let's Get to The EDA

First, we can find the most total earnings of all `Games`, `Genres` and `Release Dates:`

```{r}
Esports %>% 
  select(Game, TotalEarnings, Genre) %>% 
  arrange(desc(TotalEarnings))
```
Let's take a look at Dota2's Genre as it is the top total earning game:
```{r}
Esports %>% 
  select(Game, TotalEarnings, Genre) %>% 
  filter(Genre == "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena") %>% 
  arrange(desc(TotalEarnings))
```

We can see that Dota2 takes the cake in terms of earnings by a long shot

```{r}
round(234795551.17 - 84189144.8)
```


We can see that Dota2 has `~$150m` more total earnings than the next competing Game in the same Genre

```{r}
Esports %>% 
  select(Game, TotalEarnings, Genre) %>% 
  arrange(desc(TotalEarnings))
```
```{r}
round(234795551.17 - 117125739.01)
```


We can also see that Dota2 has `~$117m` more total earnings than the next competing Game as a whole. However we will eventually look into how many actual tournaments were played in relation to its total earnings.

For our personal interests, let's look at FPS games.

```{r}
Esports %>% 
  select(Game, TotalEarnings, Genre) %>% 
  filter(Genre == "First-Person Shooter") %>% 
  arrange(desc(TotalEarnings))
```

With no surprise on our end, we see `CS:GO` as the top dog in earnings out of all `First-Person Shooter` games.

Now let's look at the least total earned Games.
```{r}
Esports %>% 
  select(Game, TotalEarnings, Genre) %>% 
  arrange(TotalEarnings)
```
Just from this output, we can see some discrepancies with earnings such as `Halo: Infinite`. It's evident that this game has not been released yet as of 08-07-2021. Let us look at the total tournaments for said game.

```{r}
Esports %>% 
  select(Game, TotalTournaments, Genre) %>% 
  filter(Game == "Halo: Infinite")  %>% 
  arrange(TotalTournaments)
```

Coming from this output, this specific dataset has `Games` with **no** `Total Tournaments`, so lets clean this up to get rid of potential games that have not been released yet, such as `Halo: Infinite`. 


```{r}
Esports <- Esports %>% 
  filter(TotalTournaments > 0)

Esports %>% 
  select(Game, TotalEarnings, TotalTournaments, Genre) %>% 
  arrange(TotalTournaments)
```

Now that we know what games have the most total earnings, let us look at the relation between `Total Earnings` and `Total Tournaments`. 

```{r}
ggplot(Esports) +
  geom_point(aes(x = TotalTournaments, y = TotalEarnings, color = Genre, size = TotalPlayers),
             alpha = 0.6)
```



We first can see a clump of Genre's where there isn't much 'activity' in terms of tournaments or earnings. This could indicate unpopularity within the gaming community for these Genre's. Interestingly, we have one point where a `Strategy` game has had `~6000` tournaments but made much less than the big titles such as `CS:GO` or `Dota2`. Let's look at which game this could be: 

```{r}
Esports %>% 
  filter(Genre == "Strategy", TotalTournaments >= 6000) 
```

Now out of this dataset, let's determine the most popular Genres:

```{r}
ggplot(Esports) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = TotalTournaments, y = Genre)) 
  
```
Looking at the vast outliers in these Game Genre's, we can see that `First-Person Shooter` and `Strategy` genre's are leading in popularity as we have deduced from earlier (**SOLEY BASED ON TOTAL TOURNAMENTS**). However we do see that `Fighting Game` and `Multiplayer Online Battle Arena` do make up the 3rd and 4th most played game `Genre`'s respectively.
